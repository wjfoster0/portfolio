              <h3>Midsummer</h3>
              <p>Midsummer is a renewable energy wholesaler that sells solar panels, inverters, heat pumps, electric car chargers, and more to installation companies and sole installers. In 2025, they decided to update their main shop website, which had remained untouched for almost ten years.</p>

              <h3>Scope and brief</h3>
              <p>I initially sat down with the MD to discuss the requirements of the project and scope. The website needed a visual refresh with possibilities for structural reworking but there were limited resources for changing the back-end structure.</p>
              <p>It was also noted during this meeting that the Midsummer brand might also need some work, so I agreed to go away and spend some time considering how this might look.</p>

            <h2>The brand</h2>

            <div class="header-and-body">
              <h3>Brand Analysis</h3>
              <p>A brand analysis was carried out to consider where the Midsummer brand does and doesn't work. The main takeaways were the strong brand recognition, but poor logo visibility in terms of size, weight and colour. The aim would be to keep some key identifying elements whilst shaping the brand into a modern, impactful mark.</p>

              <h3>Collaboration</h3>
              <p>Following this research, I worked with the Midsummer marketing department to discuss and build a bigger picture of what people within Midsummer felt worked and didn't about the brand, and how they use the brand when marketing. It was agreed that the colours and logo held a strong identity but the brand had little direction. A proposal was drawn up to "refine the logo and define the brand".</p>
            </div>

            <div class="header-and-body">
              <h3>Logo concepts</h3>
              <p>Time was spent building initial ideated logos which were discussed during multiple meetings to further refine and collaborate on designs. These generally aimed to bring in the 'sunpath' element of the existing logo. A sunpath diagram shows the path of the sun across the year, with the top line of the chart being, midsummer's day. </p>

            <h2>The website</h2>

            <div class="header-and-body">
              <h3>Focus group</h3>
              <p>Parallel to the branding work, I was carrying out research into how the shop site should be improved. This consisted of focus groups with midsummer employees working in sales. Not only do these team members use the site themselves every day but they are also the first line of support for struggling customers. This uncovered several key takeaways:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Users prefer a top navigation system and prominent search over side menus. </li>
                <li>The search needs to be smarter.</li>
                <li>Stock info should be visible on listings, not just in the search. </li>
                <li>Stock information shows location availability but users don’t know where to find this.</li>
                <li>Product bundles have changed over time and their function for internal teams isn’t clear. </li>
                <li>Account handlers' contact info should be easier to find.</li>

              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="header-and-body">
              <h3>Customer research</h3>
              <p>It was also important to gather information on how midsummer customers shop online. So a questionnaire was built to try and gather information on how users of the site tend to shop online, both on the Midsummer website and on other sites.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>85% of users always use the search functionality on other sites and those who don't search directly from a search engine.</li>
                <li>92% of users asked, said they use filters to help find products when shopping online.</li>
                <li>The Midsummer site used an unconventional navigation structure which some users struggled with.</li>
                <li>The categorisation of some sections often caused them to miss products.</li>
                <li>A lot of external customers did not know they could find stock information on the midsummer site.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="header-and-body">
              <h3>Affinity mapping and synthesis</h3>
              <p>All the shop site research was collated and mapped onto a board to work out how the gathered information could be used to improve the site. </p>
              <p>This information was used to focus on building a site with easier and more advanced search functionality. The primary focus of these designs was helping users find products more easily, initially through an improved search functionality, and secondly through an improved navigation structure.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Proposals</h2>

            <div class="header-and-body">
              <h3>Brand</h3>
              <p>As a larger company decision, the preferred midsummer brand proposals were brought together and presented to the board of directors at Midsummer. There were elements of several which were mulled over but ultimately one proposal was chosen to be taken forward. After a small amount of further development, this was agreed as a strong development from the current midsummer brand. </p>
            </div>

            </div>

            <div class="header-and-body">
              <h3>Shop site</h3>
              <p>Several different proposals for the shop site were made and discussed. Feedback from this allowed me to go away and collate the best elements from each proposal, accounting for some new constraints and ensuring it worked well with the new brand designs, to build the design for the new midsummer shop site.</p>
