              <h3>The brief</h3>
              <p>Easy PV is a software designed to aid solar installers in the design, purchase and installation of solar systems on homes. The Easy PV Solar Marketplace is a tool to connect solar installers with homeowners, looking for a solar system for their home. Using Easy PV's automatic roof scanning it is an instant process, producing tailored quotes in as little as 5 steps. Creating a single site for homeowners to compare multiple quotes, designed specifically for their house and giving installers new leads, without the work.</p>

              <h3>Competition</h3>
              <p>There were several competitors currently in this market, some direct competitors, some offering similar products with different purposes. The first stage was to carry out a competitor analysis. This uncovered that the one main direct competitor had poor UI and was little known to potential customers. However, some indirect competitors offered a very strong user experience, both in design and function, Heatable being the strongest contender.</p>
              <p>It was noted exactly what these strengths were and how they used them. Generally it was the simplicity of the UI that made it so easy to use for potential homeowners. But being designed as a mobile-first platform also gave it a strong edge.</p>

              <h3>Wireframing</h3>
              <p>Taking this vital information onboard, a wireframe was built to consider the flow of the process, both on mobile and desktop. Ensuring a seamless product flow and simple, easy-to-use UI.</p>
              <P>Some sections of this process were built on top of an existing stucture for drawing around the roofs (a failsafe for when the auto-scanning doesn't work). This was streamlined to make it a simpler, easier-to-use process whilst still closely holding its original structure.</P>

            <div class="header-and-body">
              <h3>Testing</h3>
              <p>Once the wireframe was agreed a visual prototype was set up. This was built as a Figma prototype so it could be tested. A number of tests were carried out to see how users interacted with the software and if they could instinctively work out what they needed to do and when.</p>
              <p>Generally, the product was easily used but there were a few points which arose which required some improvement. Especially around the alrerations between mobile and desktop.</p>
